# tw-curator

The library will create a Curator Auto Configuration, which will provide a CuratorFramework bean.

It is necessary to reduce duplication in most of our libraries.

## Configuration

Usually you just need to specify `tw-curator.zookeeper-connect-string`.

Consult with `TwCuratorProperties` for options.
